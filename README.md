This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

TelehealthAI is a chatbot-driven medical assistant designed to address healthcare challenges in India, where doctor shortages prevent personalized care. Using the OpenAI API and RAG pipelines, the application gathers relevant patient information through dynamic, personalized medical questions and stores the data in MongoDB. This allows doctors to review the patient's medical history and symptoms beforehand, optimizing their time and enhancing the quality of patient care. TelehealthAI also includes multilingual support and uses Auth0 for secure, personalized user access.
Tech Stack: Javascript, NextJS, Material UI, MongoDB, OpenAI, Vercel
